Task 2: Statistical Analysis Using R
Scenario
As a consultant for a construction company, you were tasked with conducting statistical analysis on the relationship between concrete mix components and compressive strength. The company is testing different concrete mixes and wishes to understand how the mix components affect the concrete's performance.

Dataset
The analysis is based on the Concrete Compressive Strength dataset, which includes various mix components (e.g., cement, water, aggregates) and their corresponding compressive strength values.

Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Calculated summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).
Created histograms and box plots to visualize distributions of key variables (e.g., cement, water, compressive strength).
Correlation Analysis

Conducted correlation tests to examine relationships between compressive strength and mix components.
Identified strong positive/negative correlations between variables.
Regression Modelling

Developed linear regression and multiple regression models to predict compressive strength based on mix components.
Evaluated model performance using R-squared and p-values.
Hypothesis Testing

Compared compressive strength between high and low cement content.
Tested the significance of correlations between variables using t-tests and ANOVA.

Results & Findings
Cement content had a strong positive correlation with compressive strength.
Multiple regression models performed better than single-variable models, explaining more variance in strength prediction.
Hypothesis testing confirmed that higher cement content significantly improves compressive strength.
